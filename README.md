## Here is my task 

### Explore and prepare the dataset (Exploratory Data Analysis-EDA)
First, spend some time exploring the dataset in the Jupyter Notebook provided in the Resources section below to understand the different columns and some basic statistics of the dataset. Then, I focused to consider how to prepare the dataset for a predictive model. I also thinked about any new features you want to create in order to make your model even better. I did make use of the Resources provided to get you started with this task. 

### Train a machine learning model
When my data is ready for modelling, I trained a machine learning model to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking. For this task, I used some algorithms that easily allows you to output information about how each variable within the model contributes to its predictive power. For example,I found that with imbalance dataset some algorithms such as RandomForest, XGBoost are very good for this purpose. I pre-processed data and built model in file ``` Modelling_EDA_2.ipynb ```.

### Evaluate model and present findings
After training my model, I did evaluate how well it performed by conducting cross-validation and outputting appropriate evaluation metrics. Furthermore, I created a visualisation to interpret how each variable contributed to the model. Finally, I summarised your findings in a single slide.
